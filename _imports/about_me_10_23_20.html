        <p>Hi I'm Allan Luchenitser - web developer.</p>
        <p>This is a javascript, front end, web design, nodejs, vuejs, and general dev blog. Its aim is to add to the tech milieu and to elevate my visibility as a programmer. Clients, employers, and such can see my LinkedIn <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanluchenitser/" target="__blank">here</a> or can click on my sunken mug in the menu bar.</p>
        <p>The physical blog is built with the <a  class="link" href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> javascript framework, <a class="link" href="https://prismjs.com/">PrismJS</a> for syntax highlighting, and a smallest of small static site generators called <a class="link" href="https://sergey.cool/">Sergey.</a>
         Hosting is on AWS using an S3 and CloudFront combo.</p>
        <p>The visual design and responsive behavior are all my own.</p>
