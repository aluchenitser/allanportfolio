        <p>This is a javascript, front end, web design, nodejs, vuejs, and general dev blog. Its aim is to add to the tech milieu and to elevate my visibiliy as a programmer. You might find it useful!</p>
        <p>The physical blog is built with static files and no tooling (as of yet), hosted on an S3 bucket. If I add features, new articles will describe the journey.</p>
