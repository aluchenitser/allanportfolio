        <p><span class="hl">z-index</span>, the css property that nobody understands. You probably know that for visually overlapping html elements, the highest z-index sits on top. Past that you've read a zillion different explanations that all suck. I'll add to the dogpile:</p>
        <p>Lots of things can cause elements to visually overlap. These css properties, for example: <span class="hl">top</span>, <span class="hl">left</span>, <span class="hl">transform</span>, <span class="hl">float</span>, <span class="hl">position</span>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>top and left properties</li>
            <li>css transformations</li>
            <li>position: fixed, position: absolute</li>
            <li>and other stuff..</li>
        </ul>
